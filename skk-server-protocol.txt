CLIENT_REQUEST:
    request to server: '1' + dictionary_key + space + LF

                     '/' + LF
    answer if not found: '4' + dictionary_key + space + LF

Shutting down:
    The server disconnects the link and shuts down
    when received an unknown request
    on dbskkd-cdb: an internal error will cause shutdown
                   (exit(1))
