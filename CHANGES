	instead of djb's cdbmake
20090126

20090125
	inetd does not handle stderr well,
	so explicit error messages before crashing
	are all commented out
	(the fast-fail principle applied)
	setting VERBOSE_MSG as a compile flag
	will reenable the messages
	(still useful when used with ucspi-tcp)
	More comments on the code inserted
	DUMMYHOSTNAME made shorter
	NOTE: dictionary name is changed to JISYO_FILE
	      (previously JISHO -> now *JISYO*)
	      to match the SKK-JISYO.* filenames
	20090125-2 dbskkd-cdb.c performs macro replacement
		diesys(string) -> exit(1)
20090124
	dropped supporting server request '3'
	with actual hostname or IP address
	(the current syntax will be broken anyway
	 if IPv6 should be supported)
	since NO CLIENT uses this information for
	authentication or anything meaningful
	except for showing the information to the user
	when optionally requested, so the answer to
	the request is replaced by a fixed string
	defined in the DUMMYHOSTNAME macro
20090118

	  of variable datalen
